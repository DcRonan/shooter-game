## Description

> This was my final project of the JavaScript module and the aim was to create a shooter game using the framework `Phaser`

![gif](./assets/main-gif.gif)

I have a built a space shooter game that you can move your character using keys and have the ability to shooter lasers. I have added a scoring system to display your score, increment every time you shoot an enemy and the option to save it to the leaderboard. I have included a main menu which you can turn the music and sound on or off as well credits and button to play.
